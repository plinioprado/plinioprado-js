  <h3>Requirements</h3>
  <p>The functional requirements are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Modeling that can be used as a component or microservice (through a REST api) for other prototypes.</li>
    <li>Access is managed by logins by Users in multiple Role levels to multiple Tenants.</li>
    <li>Maintain Users, Roles, Tenants, and Settings.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The non-functional requirements are driven by the tech chosen to experiment with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Latest technologies and coding for the stack JavaScript/React/Node.js/PostgreSQL.</li>
    <li>Priority in maximizing clean code and minimizing dependencies.</li>
    <li>One component can handle multiple auxiliary tables using an approach where the request brings data and format (with the display info). Using inheritable models in JavaScript objects.</li>
    <li>MVC design where the Models and Controllers contain the logic ready to be recoded in classes for an OOP language.</li>
    <li>Automated unit Tests.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Development Notes</h3>

  <p>Unlike the React client, the Node server just has to be correctly coded and provide the right responses to the right requests using the given SQL database. This is because React is a dominant client but Node is one of the good options for back-end.</p>

  <p><strong>Coding reusable components using a data + format responses</strong></p>
  
  <p>The back-end focus was the implementation of a response composed of "data" and its display "format" because in an application the core components will require custom-made coding, but there is always a swarm of auxiliary tables flying around them that shouldn't take much time to just define, add and move on.</p>
  <p>Regarding "format" naming, there are variations in what we are used to seeing for the properties used to code data validation. like "mandatory" vs. "required" vs. "notNull". Here they evolved to more strict following the HTML tag attributes.</p>
