  <h3>Financial controls - CTR series</h3>
  <p>Series of public Proof of concept applications experimenting technologies that can be used in Finance control and reporting. Some of these concepts and technologies were used in actual solutions delivered for clients in the past, other are POCs for future use.</p>

  <p>There are back-ends in PHP, NoteJs/Express and Jave/Spring, using either SQL and NoSQL databases</p>
